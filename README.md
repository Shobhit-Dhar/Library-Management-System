# Created Library Management System Using Python, SQL and File Handling
* Created a password-protected database system to setup a 
virtual library, that holds record of all books with necessary 
timestamps (like issuance date, return date, etc.) to 
maintain them. This setup had browsing utility at both-user 
and admin level.  
* Leveraged SQL and Python to create a presentable and 
real-time display of books on the virtual platform, such that 
it helps customers issue their interest as per the book 
availability. 
* Established a time-system for every book issuance and a 
penalty value associated to its delay in return, if applicable. 
* Used File Handling to display some text and quotes when 
the program was opened and closed.
